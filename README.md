led-lightshow
=============

A lightshow: LEDs flash to the rhythm of music. 

Sound processing done in Processing (no pun intended), and LEDs are controlled with Arduino board. The commands to Arduino board are also sent from this Processing program, so no additional Arduino programming is needed.
